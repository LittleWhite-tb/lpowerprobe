lPowerProbe - A light benchmark tool oriented for energy probing heavely based on likwid

== Compilation ==

To generate the configure script, you have to run autogen.sh:
    ./autogen.sh
Then, you can follow the usual sequence:
    ./configure
    make
    make install

== Usage ==

./lPowerProbe [OPTION] [prog] [args]

Performs standardized and accurate measurements.
It can work in three different modes depending on the prog argument value:
	- prog is not specified: the measurement is (re)started/ended when receiving SIGUSR1.
	- prog ends by .s: it is compiled and run instrumented as a kernel.
	- otherwise: prog is run instrumented as an executable file.

  -h, --help				Display this help
  -v, --version				Display the program version

  -l, --libraries			Probes libraries to load to bench the execution
  -r, --repetition=NUMBER		Number of repetition for the test
  -d, --duplicate=NUMBER		Number of process to start
  -p, --pinning="pin1;pin2;..."		Where to pin the processes
  -o, --output="resultFile"		Where to write the results
  -m, --iteration-mem-size=NUMBER	The memory size in bytes used in the kernel per iteration
  -i, --iteration=NUMBER		The number of kernel iteration


The result is output in a file called 'output.csv'.
